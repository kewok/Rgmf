Description: This package provides a set of R tools for visualizing and
    analyzing epidemiological dynamics based on the epidemic state file produced
    after a "Give Me Fever!" exercise. Key functionalities include: estimating
    important epidemiological parameters (including the basic reproductive number
    and the force of infection), plotting time series for the different epidemic
    compartments, and visualizing the epidemic network structure through time.
